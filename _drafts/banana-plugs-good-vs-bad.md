There are different types of banana plugs.

There are some good and bad banana plug designs in my opinion and experience.

Oddly enough I cannot find anyone else discussing this topic. The closest things I have found are

* https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/516/BananaPlugs%20D7MOOCE-257160.pdf
* The fact that RS has a filter for "Spring Connector".

TODO: Link Farnell and RS ones I found.
