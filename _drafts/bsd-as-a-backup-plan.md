lets say Linux becomes infected by people will ill intention.
what other FOSS operating systems are there?

Well BSD ofc.

OpenBSD or FreeBSD you may ask?

FreeBSD...

You can roll your own with their installer and grab a desktop afterwards.

However if you just want a FreeBSD distro that is the dogs. Then look no further than GhostBSD.

Yes I have tried any other distros. Dragonfly etc

The only two I recommend are FreeBSD and GhostBSD (based on FreeBSD) for desktop use.

GhostBSD has basically everything you need. Besides games and a couple programs that are Electron based. It's perfectly usable.

I did find one odd bug with hot plugging my keyboard/mice while the system is running. I thought my USD switcher was borked but it seems GhostBSD didn't like me removing the keyboard/mouse and replugging while it was running. I forget what `lsusb` showed. I will test on my laptop shortly...

`var/log/syslog` showed connection changes but xorg problem? no mouse after replugg.

Anyway I ran GhostBSD on dell desktops and IBM laptops.

OH its missing encryption too. Not sure how to fix that.
