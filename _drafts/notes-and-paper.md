# Notes and paper

I always take notes. I find however I spread my notes across too many pieces of paper. Often a piece of scrap A4 is used for diagrams/sketches of software architecture. Other times it's Post-it Note as they were closest to hand. However I eventually end up with lots of notes spread everywhere. I realised a while back that I need to consolidate all my notes into one book. Then I always have all my notes with me. 

First rule was no Post-it Notes. 

Second rule was always have my notebook on the desk when I arrive at work so it's to hand. This prevents me reaching for Post-it Notes.

I recently got back into mechanical pencils. I was looking at all types however I found out what Adam Savages favourite mechanical pencil is. It's the cheap disposable [PaperMate 0.7 mm Non-Stop](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PaperMate-Non-Stop-Mechanical-Pencil-Yellow/dp/B000SHSC5U). This was revolutionary and once I got my hand on one I soon fell in love. The rubber is a key part to a pencils usefulness over pens, any pencil without an attached rubber is useless to me.

Coincidentally I recently also started reading Adam Savages new book "Every Tool's A Hammer: Life Is What You Make It". In the book he details his note taking techniques. I was again instantly understanding and wanting to try it for my self. I have used several note taking methods previously. Mostly lined paper with ticks at the end of lines I have completed.

The technique Adam showed allowed for even more information to be displayed. That is partially complete tasks. Previously I would note a tilde ~ to show partially complete items.

I wasn't strict enough on myself with notes but I was working towards improving them already. Adams book confirmed my suspicion that note taking should be taken very seriously and thus the rabbit hole begins.

I noticed this new note taking system would work well with squared paper. I see Adam using plain and square paper in his examples. I was pondering which paper is the most universal. That way I was sure to only need one notebook. The paper needs to work for strongly typed notes (spaced nicely to the page), loosely typed notes (annotations), not to scale diagrams, to scale diagrams and drawings.

I did a bit of research on the different paper types. I started with my own notebooks. I noticed some interesting things. Lined paper isn't always the same line spacing. Rite in the rain have a special "universal" format which I cannot find anyone else doing. It's lined with dotted less visible grid. The grid avoids visual overload but its there when required. [Click for for example](https://cdn3.volusion.com/fyqtn.tvutc/v/vspfiles/photos/RITR-774-MX-3.jpg)

USA notebook was inches spacing. UK was mm spacing. Germany has a standard of 6mm line spacing.

In the USA they seem to have "College Paper" and "High School Paper". I know we do something similar in the UK and my Lithuanian friend confirmed they also do this. Basically in schools they start with paper which has a large line spacing. When the child gets older they get paper with standard line spacing. It makes it easier for them until they have improved their hand writing. There are also various special paper types which aid hand writing.

Hardback notebooks are better in general because I carry them around in my 5.11 backpack. This prevents damage and it makes the book much easier to read and write on because it remains rigid.

Square paper spacing varies. 5 mm seems to be the most common. 1cm is around for school use.

The paper shouldn't bleed when using felt pens.

I don't write on both sides. I find it inconvenient.

Digital notes are useful but not practical for diagrams or annotation unless using a very expensive tablet with a proper digitizer. I do however type documentation up in Markdown and use draw.io for finalised architecture diagrams.

Pens I will discuss at some point in the future. Mostly using [Zebra F-xMD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zebra-F-xMD-Ballpoint-1-0mm-Silver/dp/B0728GN7T3/) and the [PaperMate 0.7 mm Non-Stop](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PaperMate-Non-Stop-Mechanical-Pencil-Yellow/dp/B000SHSC5U).

"Lined Paper" is also known as "Ruled Paper".

"Squared Paper" is also known as "Grid Paper".

Engineering paper is basically fancy graph paper.

## Paper spacing

Below is a table of various notebooks I have and their line spacing. Most besides the "Rite in the Rain" are from the UK to my knowledge.

| Staples Manuscript       | lined       | A4     | 8 mm           | 5/16 in          |

I also saw on Amazon that Cambridge, Oxford Campus and Oxford Black n' Red notebooks use 8 mm line spacing.

Oddly enough there isn't currently a United Kingdom subheading on the [Wikipedia ruled paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_paper) page for line spacing. Furthermore I couldn't find a British standard for line spacing.
