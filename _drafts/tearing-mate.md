If you get screen tearing on mate desktop try using "Marco (Compton GPU compositor)" or "Compiz (Advance GPU accelerated desktop effects)" under "Mate Tweak".

UPDATE: This post as been sat around in my drafts so long they have supposedly fixed Marco screen tearing.

It seems this also effects the screen turning off properly when screen timeout occurs.
