### Just setup my blog.

Greetings I just got the blog setup on my Github pages under a separate repo. I decided to use [Carte Noire](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/carte-noire/) Jekyll site theme since it looks pretty clean.

Hopefully I will be posting about personal things of interest, computer programming, computer networking, tips and tricks, Linux, FOSS and more.

This blog is written using Markdown from within Atom IDE or VIM inside TMUX. This allows for rapid development and the content still remains plain text readable if I don't have a render running.
