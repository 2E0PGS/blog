### My first venture into trying ergonomic ball mice to help with wrist RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) while using computers.

Being a computer programmer I can be using a computer for hours a day (_or night_). Many years of this have caused me to get pains in my palm of my hand and sometimes wrist. I recently decided to try a ergonomic mouse out of necessity due to pain.

I acquired the following from Amazon: [Logitech M570 Wireless Mouse](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0042BBR2S/r) and it does help relieve some of the pain when I need it. However I found it's actually quite tricky for precision pointing tasks such as selecting text in Visual Studio when programming. I didn't realise just how accurate regular mice are in this regard until now. With that I tried to stick with it by trying to use the keyboard for precision text selection when needed. I then decided I should probably try use the keyboard as much as possible in general to avoid any further wrist strain.

In the Linux world with a terminal workflow it's quite easy to avoid using a mouse. Windows not so much because you normally need a mouse to interact with each window and that is just the way most programs are designed for now.

Another unexpected thing I noticed was my Android mobile phone caused me to get hand cramps if used for a couple hours solid typing. Luckily this doesn't happen very often but it was something that effected my RSI quite badly when it did.
