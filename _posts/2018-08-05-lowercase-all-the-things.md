### Deciding on a personal file naming convention.

If you haven't read my other post on [Programmers grammar](https://2e0pgs.github.io/blog/programming/2018/08/05/programmers-grammar/) I suggest you do so before reading this one for a bit of background.

Reasons:

* Easier on autocomplete in terminals. No need to hold shift.
