# IC-7100 Hamlib

Using cron and rigctl from [Hamlib](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib) to control my IC-7100

I make use of `rigctl` which is a CLI tool that gets built when you make Hamlib.

This is a sample of my crontab. Basically at 30 mins past 9am on Sunday it will run `rigctl` and control the radio on the port `ttyUSB0` with radio model `370` (IC-7100) which is only available if you build it from source as support for that radio has only recently been added. It then changes the current memory channel to `29` which is what I have GB3ZB programmed in as.

## The crontab file

```sh
# Change radio to GB3ZB on Sunday morning for GB2RS news.
30 9 * * 7 /home/peter/rigctl-gb2rs-started.sh

# Change radio to GB3BS after GB2RS news has ended.
0 10 * * 7 /home/peter/rigctl-gb2rs-ended.sh
```

## rigctl-gb2rs-started.sh script

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Change radio to GB3ZB on Sunday morning for GB2RS news.

# Grab current vol.
/usr/local/bin/rigctl -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -m 370 l AF > ~/.current-volume

# Change volume to be audible.
/usr/local/bin/rigctl -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -m 370 L AF 0.2

# Change memory channel.
/usr/local/bin/rigctl -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -m 370 E 29
```

## rigctl-gb2rs-ended.sh script

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Change radio to GB3BS after GB2RS news has ended.

# Set volume back.
/usr/local/bin/rigctl -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -m 370 L AF `cat ~/.current-volume`

# Change memory back to GB3BS since Hamlib cannot retrieve current memory from IC-7100 yet.
/usr/local/bin/rigctl -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -m 370 E 31
```
