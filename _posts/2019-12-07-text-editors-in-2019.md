# A state of text editors in late 2019

## Here are my current main editors

* [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) I use this for daily simple text edits or displaying. _Notice about recent CVE_.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I use this for .NET Core, .NET Standard, NodeJS, Python, Angular and Markdown.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) I use this for NodeJS, Python and Markdown.
* [Visual Studio 2017 Professional](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) I use this for .NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET Standard and some Python debugging.
* [Visual Studio 2017 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) I use this for .NET Framework.

### Notice about Atom vs VS Code

I am now slowly dropping Atom for VS Code due to speed and built in packages. As much as I like module software Atom has become too slow. VS Code now has all the same features (mostly built-in) and it's much faster.

I think VS Code is now the focus over Atom given Microsoft acquired GitHub.

It seems Atom is quite fast on Linux still however on Windows VS Code is much faster.

## Other editors I occasionally use

* [Pluma](https://github.com/mate-desktop/pluma) Used rarely.
* [Notepad](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-notepad/9msmlrh6lzf3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) Used on Windows servers to display large log files.
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) I dont use N++ these days. Only if I help someone else who uses it. _Notice about recent CVE_.
* [GNU Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) Linux servers that dont have full VIM installed.

## Notes

It seems the lines between extreemly light text editor, code editor and full on IDE are blurring.

We are seeing many editors head towards these middle ground, modular, lightweight IDEs like Atom/VS Code.

This is probably due to the rise of new languages that have their own CLI tool chains.
