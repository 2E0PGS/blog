# Useful trick for Icom DPRS settings

I found that if you set the ID-51 to "Gateway CQ" and then select your hotspot/gateway memory it will allow you to hear traffic from the reflector and TX DPRS automatically without it going through everyone's radio via the reflector and still appear on APRS.FI. Then when your ready to talk to someone you simply switch back to "Your Call Sign"/"Use Repeater".
