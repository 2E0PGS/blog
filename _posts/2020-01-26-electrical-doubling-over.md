# Doubling over cable conductors

To double over or not to double over conductors? That's the question.

## Research references

No one seems to mention multistrand doubling over. I only found resources for single core. There was some discussion about multistrand twisting strands together however.

## Personal notes

* I have seen single-core doubled conductors snap if opened back out straight. Copper becomes brittle.
* Doubling helps with smaller conductor diameter when inserted into a large connection block.
* Multistrand "electronics" cable I always twist strands together then double over if required. Increases biting surface area. Multistrand is also less likely to becomes brittle in my experience.
* single-core don't twist two conductors together because it's a pain when adding an additional conductor into the connector block terminal. It also causes fatigue on the conductor. Double over can suffer when adding extra conductors to a connector block.
* single-core can be doubled over if it's unlikely another connector will be added to the connector block. For example a light switch that controls one lamp. This is in agreement with the above PDF resource: "Where fitting one conductor only, double over the conductors".

## Summary

* Double over if the cable diameter is too small acording to your personal disgression.
* Multistrand should always have strands twisted together.
* Bootlace ferrule or soldering multistrand conductors for termination into connector blocks I will save for another blog post some time.
