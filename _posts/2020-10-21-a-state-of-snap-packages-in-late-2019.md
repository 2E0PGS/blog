# Using snaps where possible in late 2019

Ubuntu 19.10 running in a VirtualBox VM.

We are starting to see the turn to snaps in Ubuntu 19.10. Ubuntu has been shipping with a couple snaps for a while but we are seeing a ever increasing amount of apps becoming snaps by default. Here I install a few more and test using entirely snap where possible.

See my comments in the screenshot vim terminal.

I believe there were two packages for each program under the Ubuntu software store, one for snap version and one for non-snap.

Looks promising, although I would like to see a bit more security from snaps such as better file system isolation or less permitted by default.
