# A state of messaging apps in late 2020

* Occasionally I checkout the latest messaging apps for fun. 
* Over the years I have tried pretty much every app that looks usable.
* I may include a few apps/services which aren't strictly IM (Instant Messaging) apps.
* There is quite a wide breadth of alternative messaging apps many may not be aware of.

## Common

* WhatsApp - Recently implemented E2E encryption I believe it's based on Signal Protocol. Web app is great.
* WeChat - More commonly used in Asia.
* SMS/MMS - It's a useful backup.
* Email - Probably hit its peak a long time ago, now becoming outdated.
* Skype
* Facebook Messenger
* Snapchat - False sense of privacy.
* Kik
* Viber
* LINE
* iMessage - Apple specific.
* Steam chat - Steam specific.
* Xbox Live - Xbox specific.
* PSN aka PlayStation Messages - PSN specific.

## Common team chats

* House party
* Zoom
* Webex
* Microsoft Teams - Typing latency but decent VOIP.
* Google Meets
* Google Hangouts
* Slack - The VOIP sucks but chat is great.
* Gitter - Specific to OSS development for the most part.
* Discord - Also implements a half decent VOIP. Although it's webRTC based which can cause issues with routing.

## Early IM

* IRC
* ICQ
* AIM
* Yahoo Messenger
* Pidgin/Libpurple
* MSN Messenger aka Windows Live Messenger
* eBuddy

## Early VOIP

* Mumble - Open source and self hosted.
* TeamSpeak - You can host your own secure server, the only downside is the text chat is basic and it's not open source.
* Asterisk - Great VOIP software but has a bit of a learning curve unless using FreePBX.

## Decentralised focused team chats

* Riot.im aka Matrix aka element - They boast a huge selection of bridges/connectors which allow you to link various chat systems.
* rocket.chat - Self hosted Discord/Slack alternative.
* Jami
* Mattermost
* Jitsi - Open source Zoom alternative.
* Zulip

## Privacy focused

* Signal - Probably the forerunner in this category.
* FireChat - Mesh networking.
* Briar - A modern version of FireChat imo.
* Telegram
* BCM - Blockchain messenger.
* DeltaChat - IM style PGP email.
* Session - Very cool as it only requires a GUID to chat, although their servers had uptime issues.
* Keybase - The social network for PGP key owners.
* Tox - Not tested.
* PGP/GPG email - A classic but rather involved setup email encryption solution.
* Wire - Not tested.
* Threema - Not tested.
