# Fitbit notes

I have been using a Fitbit Versa 2 for two years now so here are a few of my notes on it.

* Has a few days battery life.
* The email summaries of your week is nice.
* Step counting works fine along with most metrics.
* App UI is quite nice and easy on the eyes. Perhaps the advance settings are a little tricky to find but you rarely need to change those.
* Sleep tracking is a useful feature.
* They recently added SpO2 tracking so that must of been limited by software previously.
* My original strap broke fairly easily as I anticipated due to the charging cradle splaying out the strap ends flat when normally they tend to curve. This caused excessive wear.
	* Their support forwarded on my email to their UK support team but no one followed it up. The watch was still in warranty but I just ended up buying a new metal strap myself in the end.
* I had some firmware and/or Android app updates break the syncing of the watch a few times. This required me to hard reboot the Fitbit by holding down two or three buttons at once.
* Cycling activities via automatic exercise detection or manually recording exercise randomly stopped counting towards the daily miles.
	* I researched this a bit and some people say it never counts towards daily totals and others seemed to agree with my recollection. 
	* I contacted Fitbit support and they seemed to believe it should be counting towards the daily total. I spent a good while going back and forth on emails with their support.
	* Their support was a bit slow to reply and sometimes needed follow up emails.
	* I tried most things they suggested already such as hard reboots, factory resetting the watch, reinstalling the Android app and finally clearing all Android app data.
	* I believe it was caused by a Android app update.
	* I never resolved it with their support and I wonder if it has been fixed since. 
	* Firmware versions of the watch and Android app versions were taken.
	* Make/model of my phone along with Android version was noted.
	* The activity did show perfectly fine under the activity log but it would hang upon finishing the activity which makes me wonder if that daily total is updated via a post activity trigger maybe a DB trigger.
