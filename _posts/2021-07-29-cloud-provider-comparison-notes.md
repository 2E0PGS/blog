# Cloud provider comparison notes

Mostly based around my workflows and use cases so it may miss out some products along with being time sensitive. 

## AWS

* [Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator)
* [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
* [AWS pricing as MSP](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/99zjxs/aws_pricing_as_msp/e4saqqj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

### EC2

* [Estimate for a MC server](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=79c40fb3d8634a44c35f9083db08d127b2fc7195) (61.30 USD monthly)
* [Estimate for a Windows server](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=0190475dcf932284a083ec6cd6b094adc4640c72) (81.44 USD monthly)
* Mac dedicated host.
	* [How to access Amazon EC2 MacOS instance GUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c46ifRWVLyc)
* Doesn't clean up disks when you kill a VM unless you set "Delete on termination".
* AWS seems to have smaller OS disks by default but you pay for all of it (thick provisioned).

### Lightsail

* Kinda like a simplified GUI bolted onto normal AWS console. Makes AWS simplified like a old school VPS provider.

More of a side by side comparison/observational notes.

> reddit, Instacart, and Lyft are some of the popular companies that use Amazon S3, whereas Azure Storage is used by Starbucks, Yammer, and Microsoft. Amazon S3 has a broader approval, being mentioned in 3194 company stacks & 1559 developers stacks; compared to Azure Storage, which is listed in 82 company stacks and 42 developer stacks.

* [Azure docs comparing to AWS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/aws-professional/services)
* Azure easy RDP access
* Azure option of Windows 10 virtual machine which is currently not possible on AWS, however: [Windows Virtual Desktop non-persistent desktops](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/192665/windows-virtual-desktop-non-persistent-desktops.html)
* Azure easy auto shutdown option. Shows estimates on pricing when provisioning. 
* TODO: Azure cost vs AWS for Windows VM.
* AWS also easy rdp access, option for Windows server only with no desktop. Nice desktop wallpaper overlay to show IP and hostname. No auto shutdown, no cost estimate on provisioning. 
* AWS free tier on EC2 micro.
* Azure free is an internal page inside their portal along with being a public website page. AWS free is only a public website page.
[Azure free services](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/FreeServicesBlade)
* AWS EC2 provisioning, cold start and regular start-up is faster than Azure.
* Ability to disk export in Azure virtual machine via a link.
* I think EC2 restoring snapshot breaks RDP password... yes it does so stop and start VM. don't try reboot as it doesn't update the "get pass"
* Azure makes it easier to view all resources: [Browse all resources](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseAll)
* AWS: "Tag filters are required." which means you have to tag everything in order to not loose track of it.
* EC2 restore launch state on storage device makes it easier than Azure to reset a VM to it's original image.
* Azure you need a backup to be able to restore the VM: [Factory reset Windows Server 2016 on Azure](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45457898/factory-reset-windows-server-2016-on-azure)
* Reload/refresh icon on AWS console for EC2 instances didn't work, I had to use browser refresh specifically to see a change in "Instance state"
* \> Your services were disabled because you reached your spending limit
	* Azure Cost analysis (preview) is good.
* Azure RDP you set the username and password but AWS it's created for you when you restart it and upload the pem key to decrypt it.
* AWS RDP drops if you try copying a large file.
* Azure console has a strange horizontal scrolling UI.
* OTT browser security settings on AWS and Azure Windows server images however I used wWindows 10 desktop on Azure which doesn't have such security settings.
